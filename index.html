        MY EDA EXPERIENCE SO FAR!!
            </p>
            <p>
              So the EDA experience has been fantastic.  There has been alot of support and everyone is super supportive during a full on brain overload of a first week.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have really enjoyed the collective approach to leaning.  The key for me this week has been to slow down, read through the content slowly move through each task.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coming into the academy once a week has really given me more confidence, and has eased my thoughts about bootcamp dramatically.  I would encourage everyone to do it if possiable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The culture at EDA is really open and feels really safe.  I think that engaging with this type of culture will really suit me as I think it will most people.  This really is the learning environment of the furture!!
            </p>
            <p>
              So at the end of the first week i'm not sure if my expectations of EDA have changed, but the expectations of myself have.  I am feeling more confident and am expecting bigger things of myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Am I excited about participating in this kind of learning environment?  The simple answer to that is Hell Yes!!
